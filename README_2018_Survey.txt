Hello. Welcome to my breakdown of the 2018 new coder survey hosted by freecodecamp.

In this notebook, I clean the data as well as provide general demographics.

I then narrow in on identifying markets for e-learning, which includes more cleaning of the data, and looks at user share by country, average monthly spending by country, and finally total market share by country (users and average expenditure).

Enjoy!
